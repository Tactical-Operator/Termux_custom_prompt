How to Install Termux properly :-

Install Termux from https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/tag/v0.118.3 , the best option is the _universal.apk .

Don't download from the play store as it is not updated, you can download from F-droid as well if you want.

Give all the permissions to setup termux .

You need to download a Font pack JetBrainsMono Nerd Font from https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads 

Extract the ZIP using your file manager.

~$ cd .. # to go to the previous directory

~$ cd .. # to go to the first starting directory i.e home 

Now you need to make .termux file to contain the font pack

~$ mkdir -p ~/.termux

~$ cp ~/storage/downloads/JetBrainsMonoNerdFontMono-Regular.ttf ~/.termux/font.ttf

now type the following 

~$ nano ./bashrc , then paste the thing:-   export PS1='\e[1;35m\e[1;32mâ”Œâ”€â”€(\e[1;35m(YourNAme)\e[1;32mðŸ’€(YourNAMe)-[\w]\n\e[1;35m\e[1;34mâ””â”€\e[1;35m$\e[0mÂ '

THEN typo Ctrl O then Type Ctrl X.

THEN TYPE
